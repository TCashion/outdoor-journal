    1. Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint). 
    2. Add the UI (link and/or form) that will trigger the HTTP request that matches the route.
    3. Define the route in the appropriate router module that will match the HTTP request and map it to the <controller>.<method> that will perform the desired functionality.
    4. Add the controller action/method and be sure to export it.
    5. In the controller, perform necessary CRUD and either render (passing it data) in the case of a GET request, or redirect if data has been mutated (POST, PUT & DELETE). If rendering, code the view template if necessary.

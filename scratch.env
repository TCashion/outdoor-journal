    1. Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint). 
    2. Add the UI (link and/or form) that will trigger the HTTP request that matches the route.
    3. Define the route in the appropriate router module that will match the HTTP request and map it to the <controller>.<method> that will perform the desired functionality.
    4. Add the controller action/method and be sure to export it.
    5. In the controller, perform necessary CRUD and either render (passing it data) in the case of a GET request, or redirect if data has been mutated (POST, PUT & DELETE). If rendering, code the view template if necessary.

AAU, I want to be able to like the comments 

    1. Determine the "proper" route (HTTP Method & Endpoint). 
    
        POST /trips/:tripId/comments/:commentId/likes

    2. Add the UI (link and/or form) that will trigger the HTTP request that matches the route.

        Button on comment 

    3. Define the route in the appropriate router module that will match the HTTP request and map it to the <controller>.<method> that will perform the desired functionality.

        on comments router
        router.post(/trips/:tripId/comments/:commentId/likes, authorizations.isLoggedIn, commentsCtrl.updateLikes)

    4. Add the controller action/method and be sure to export it.

        function updateLikes() will do same as likes on logs

    5. In the controller, perform necessary CRUD and either render (passing it data) in the case of a GET request, or redirect if data has been mutated (POST, PUT & DELETE). If rendering, code the view template if necessary.
